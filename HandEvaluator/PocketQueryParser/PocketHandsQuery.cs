// Much of this code is derived from poker.eval (look for it on sourceforge.net).
// This library is covered by the LGPL Gnu license. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html 
// for more information on this license.

// This code is a very fast, native C# Texas Holdem mask evaluator (containing no interop or unsafe code). 
// This code can enumarate 35 million 5 card hands per second and 29 million 7 card hands per second on my desktop machine.
// That's not nearly as fast as the heavily macro-ed poker.eval C library. However, this implementation is
// in roughly the same ballpark for speed and is quite usable in C#.

// The speed ups are mostly table driven. That means that there are several very large tables included in this file. 
// The code is divided up into several files they are:
//      HandEvaluator.cs - base mask evaluator
//      HandIterator.cs - methods that support IEnumerable and methods that validate the mask evaluator
//      HandAnalysis.cs - methods to aid in analysis of Texas Holdem Hands.
//      PocketHands.cs - a class to manipulate pocket hands.
//      PocketQueryParser - a parser used to interprete pocket mask query language statements.
//                          The runtime portion of the query parser is copyrighted by Malcolm Crowe (but is freely distributable)
